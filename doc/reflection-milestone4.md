# Features Implemented

Our dashboard is spread across 3 pages of content. It had a slide bar with an introduction of the project. There are three navbars which can go to different pages.

## Page 1

Shows count of airbnb listings and their distributions in differnt neighbourhoods across seven major Canadian cities.

By selecting a city, shows different neighbourhoods and price ranges.

The page accomplishes a relatively good level of interactivity, by selecting different cities, neighbourhoods, prices, the listing numbers, maps and top hosts change accordingly

## Page 2

Gives a glimpse of some insights into available room types.

## Page 3

Gives an overview of price trends in different cities.

# Features to Improve On

The loading time of the dashboard graphs are too long. Plots take a long time to load, mainly because we could not reduce the dataset size as it would cause some of the features to misbehave. It will take some time to find a workaround for that.

# Some thoughts

Our dashboard ensures that each graph and selector was clearly labelled with a description of its purpose and the relationship of the data within the graph. This was crucial in ensuring that users could easily understand the meaning behind each visualization and selector without any confusion. Additionally, the consistent styling between pages helped maintain a cohesive look and feel throughout the dashboard.

The feedback received from the teaching assistant and users was valuable in improving the usability of the dashboard. The suggestions to modifying the font type of the listings distribution to be more similar to the one you use for the slider title and to reduce the size of the image so everything can be seen without using a slider are very valuable.

During the development process, linking each page together using different py files helped streamline the modification process. This helped isolate issues and pinpoint specific areas for improvement. The addition of cards to the dashboard layout also helped to enhance the visual appearance of the dashboard, making it more appealing and user-friendly.

Overall, the development of the dashboard was a collaborative effort that involved incorporating user feedback, making changes, and refining the design to create a user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard.

Developing dashboards not only serves as a useful tool for presenting data in a clear and concise manner, but it also provides an opportunity for us to improve our skills in all aspects, including design and coding skills.

When designing a dashboard, it is important to consider the overall aesthetics of the platform. Designing the layout of the dashboard to be intuitive and easy to navigate is crucial to its success.

In terms of coding, we are required to retrieve features and adapt our code according to feedback. By doing so, we are able to strengthen our coding skills and become more adept at problem-solving.

Developing dashboards also provides a valuable opportunity to work with data and visualize it in meaningful ways. This allows us to better understand the data and the insights that can be gleaned from it. Through the process of creating a dashboard, we are able to improve our data analysis skills and become more proficient in data visualization techniques.
